## Hello World! ðŸ‘‹
I'm Zach, I've been in the trenches of kitchens for almost 2 decades I'm a Lead Line Cook by trade, and have always been an aspiring developer, May 2024, I decided to make a bigger change in my life taking what I've learned in kitchens and hopefully being part of the forefront of incorporating AI into kitchens in the future. I already have a couple projects in mind, but I have one main one I'm focused on, but I have a bit to learn, as well as some math to brush up on. Feels good man!
